	<h1>Additional Resources</h1>
	<p>
		There are many web sites and freeware utilities out on the web that combined with IconMasterXP provide
		you with a full set of tools you need to create professional icons. Most of the time you will need a 
		precise vector-based drawing software capable of outputting a fully qualified PNG or SVG file.

	<h2><a target="_blank" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997636.aspx">MSDN Tutorial - Creating Windows&reg; Icons (article ms997636)</a></h2>
	<p>
		This article discusses how to design and create colorful and dynamic icons for Windows&reg;
		using a vector program, such as FreeHand&reg; or Illustrator&reg;, and Photoshop&reg;. (19 printed
		pages). This is an extensive tutorial that will reveal to you how Microsoft&reg; created
		very first alpha layered icons.<br />
		This is an important read for anyone who wishes to create icons for use in Windows&reg;-based software.

	<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/rasterizer.html">Apache Batik SVG Rasterizer</a></h2>
	<p>
		The SVG Rasterizer is a utility that can convert SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
		files to a raster format. The tool can convert individual files or sets of files,
		making it easy to convert entire directories of SVG files. The provided formats
		are JPEG, PNG and TIFF, however the design allows new formats to be added easily.
		In addition, the rasterizer can (despite its name) transcode to PDF.<br />
		This tool is very useful when your drawing software does not correctly produce PNG
		files such as all versions of CorelDRAW&reg; package.

	<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.qualibyte.com/pixelformer/">Pixelformer</a></h2>
	<p>
		Pixelformer is a bitmap editor, specifically optimized for creating, modifying, and converting small and medium-sized images, such as icons, buttons, web graphics, sprites, etc.<br />
		Pixelformer is faster, smaller, easier, more precise, and often more efficient than large bitmap editing tools; at the same time it is more powerful and less limited than classic simple icon editors.
	</p>

	<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></h2>
	<p>
		Inkscape is an Open Source vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to
		Illustrator&reg;, Freehand&reg;, CorelDRAW&reg;, or Xara using the W3C standard
		Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) file format. Supported SVG features include shapes,
		paths, text, markers, clones, alpha blending, transforms, gradients, patterns, and
		grouping. Inkscape also supports Creative Commons meta-data, node editing, layers,
		complex path operations, bitmap tracing, text-on-path, flowed text, direct XML editing,
		and more. It imports formats such as Postscript, EPS, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF and exports
		PNG as well as multiple vector-based formats.

	<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a></h2>
	<p>
		The GIMP is a GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed piece of
		software for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring.
		In short it is a best free replacement for Photoshop&reg; to date.
	</p>

	<h2><a target="_blank" href="http://www.iconfinder.com">Iconfinder</a></h2>
	<p>
		This is a very useful search engine working on top of <b>huge</b> indexed icon database. Often,
		you will encounter icons in undesirable format which is when IconMasterXP kicks in to help.<br />
		Definitely pay a visit to this site if you are low on resources involving custom design.
