	<h1>Importing Image Files</h1>
	<p>
		Use <b>Import</b> feature to add images into working area for editing and later
		conversion. To import images into IconMasterXP:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Drag desired image files from Windows&reg; Explorer or similar program into the workspace.
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Press the <b>Import</b> button from the toolbar.
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Through main menu: <b>File &rarr; Import</b>
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Use the right-click menu on the bottom workspace area.
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Press <b>Ctrl + O</b> keyboard shortcut.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		After that, a dialog will show up providing you with standard explorer-like file
		browser to select one or more files.
	</p>
	<img src="import01.jpg" alt="Import Dialog" />
	<p>
		If you already have some images imported, you will be asked if you want to remove
		them or not. You do not have to remove them, it does not matter how many times you
		imported images, they can just be added to the current list.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you are importing PSD files, the import process may take few seconds to finish
		due the fact that IconMasterXP does not internally support PSD format. If an error
		is encountered with some file or files, IconMasterXP will report the error and continue
		importing rest of the files.
	</p>
	<p>
		When program has imported all the files, you will get a sorted list of all valid
		images. You may see an exclamation mark on some icons in the list, this is due to an error
		while displaying preview image - it does not always mean that associated file is corrupt.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Currently, GIF file format is not listed as allowed format. However, that format
			can be imported. You can import any GIF file, including GIF animations. However,
			you cannot export them.</li>
		<li>Some icons (and gifs) are multipage files, IconMasterXP will properly import all
			of the pages/images. See <a href="Exporting.htm#multipage">Multipage Feature</a>
			for more information on multipage files.</li>
	</ol>
