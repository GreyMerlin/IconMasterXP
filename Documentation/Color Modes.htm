	<h1>Supported Color Modes or Bit-Depths</h1>
	<p>To change a bit-depth of all currently selected images:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Through main menu, click <b>Edit &rarr; Bit Depth &rarr; [Desired Color Mode]</b><br />
			Read more bellow on possible color modes.
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Use the right-click menu on the bottom workspace area.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		IconMasterXP supports most common image color modes and allows you to convert images
		both ways. Color mode or bit-depth is a most important attribute of an image and
		using it properly in your designs greatly improves quality of your work.<br />
		Windows&reg; icons in particular usually require you to support all common bit depts so the icon
		is displayed properly in all modes. For example having a monochromatic version of your icon stored
		in the multi-paged icon file is a basic requirement for many software applications.
	</p>
	<p>Further bellow is an explanation for each supported bit-depth.</p>
	
	<h1>32-Bit, True Color Plus 8-Bit Alpha Channel</h1>
	<p>
		This is actually a 24-bit image with 8 bit alpha channel included. When you export
		an image with this format, it will be detected as 24-bit image, but most programs
		in Windows XP support alpha channel and will display your image correctly. On the
		other hand, if certain program that does not support alpha channels attempts to
		render 32-bit image, it would display it with rendering errors, such as black pixels
		around that image. In order to avoid this undesirable effect, you should always
		consider exporting icons that have at least one more bit-depth format besides 32-bit
		(multi-page icon files, see <a href="Exporting.htm">Exporting</a>)
	</p>

	<h1>24-Bit, True Color</h1>
	<p>
		This format should only be used when necessary; it is a bitmap with no palette and
		no alpha-channel. Also, avoid using this format when exporting icons, 8-bit palette
		is recommended and common amongst icon designers. Also known as, "true color", this
		format is used usually for images with more than 256 colors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since resulting file size is directly proportional to the number of colors used,
		expect enormous files if you use this format for exporting bitmapped images or icons.
		Note that, when you work with this format, number of colors is actually infinite,
		so you do not need to worry about palettes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some special effects and features in IconMaster require images to be converted to
		24-bit mode first and then converted to any desirable format when done.
	</p>
	
	<h1>8-Bit, Optimized Palette With Error Diffusion</h1>
	<p>
		This is well known format and very common in practice. There is usually a dilemma
		with this format, should you use compressed 24-bit image or standard 8-bit? Answer
		is both, the good thing about 8-bit image is palette, it is consisted of 256 different
		colors, and each has their index (place in the palette). If you on the other hand,
		need more than 256 colors, or your image is colossal &mdash; give chance to JPEG compression.
		When exporting Windows&reg; icons, this format is usually a must.
	</p>
	<p>
		IconMaster has built-in color dithering system (palette optimizer with error diffusion) so
		it will reduce number of colors without harming image quality.<br />

		colors) version of the same image on the right.

		<li>You can manipulate color palette directly. See <a href="Palette Editor.htm">Palette Editor</a></li>
		<li>The larger the image is, loss of quality will become more noticable.</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>4-Bit, Standard VGA With Error Diffusion</h1>
	<p>
		This 16-color format is used only for VGA graphic mode. It has palette consisted
		of 16 fixed colors which cannot be changed. This format is also used by memory-friendly
		software, although it is now obsolete it is still used in certain programs with
		extremely large number of graphical elements, in order to reduce memory-usage and
		performance strain.

	<h2 class="note">Notes</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Creative designers can draw very functional, clear and good-looking icons with only
		16 colors</li>
		<li>This was a default color mode of old 16-bit operating systems (eg. Windows&reg; 3.11).</li>
	</ol>

	<h1>1-Bit, Monochrome (2 Colors) With Dithering</h1>
	<p>
		This is monochromatic mode, which means it has no actual colors - only black and
		white. It is used by special software for better compatibility. Lately however,
		minimalistic design styles have returned monochrome icons back into fashion.
