	<h1>Soften</h1>
	<p>
		Soften filter alters color differences in an image through Gaussian blur filter.
		To put it simply, it basically blurs the original image. It will greatly affect
		edges in an image, without loosing important detail.<br />
		It is mostly used to create shadow effects or smooth and simple animations with
		couple of frames.<br />
		To use soften:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Through main menu, click <b>Filters &rarr; Soften</b>
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Press <b>Ctrl + T</b> keyboard shortcut.
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Use the right-click menu on the bottom workspace area.
		</li>	
	</ul>
	<p>After this, all selected images will have the filter applied. Bellow is an example of this filter.</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="dices.jpg" alt="Filter Sample" /></td>
			<td><img src="soften_sharpen01.jpg" alt="Filter Sample" /></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Original image</td>
			<td>After filter was applied</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br />
	<h1>Sharpen</h1>
	<p>
		Sharpen filter is the opposite of soften &mdash; it creates a greater color difference
		so some parts of an image become clearer and more easily discernable.<br />
		To use sharpen:
	</p>
	<p>After this, all selected images will have the filter applied. Bellow is an example of this filter.</p>
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="dices.jpg" alt="Filter Sample" /></td>
			<td><img src="soften_sharpen02.jpg" alt="Filter Sample" /></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Original image</td>
			<td>After filter was applied</td>
