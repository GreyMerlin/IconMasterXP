	<h1>Rotating Images</h1>
	<p>
		You can rotate selected images to a desirable angle by using this feature. To rotate one or more images:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Through main menu: <b>Edit &rarr; Rotate</b>
			<br />- Or -<br />
			Use the right-click menu on the bottom workspace area.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		After that, a dialog will show up allowing you to chose rotation angle and interpolation
		method (antialiasing).
	</p>
	<img src="rotate01.jpg" alt="Rotate Dialog" />
	<p>
		You can also chose not to resize the image when rotating. Certain images cannot
		fit their canvas after being rotated so program will automatically resize it by
		default.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can choose between five interpolation methods, each giving slightly different
		results. There is very small difference between these methods so you are encouraged
		to experiment. Most commonly used methods are bilinear for vector/text/line art
		and bicubic for photography - different results are given for different graphics.
	</p>

	<h1>Mirroring and Flipping</h1>
	<p>You can also quickly flip an image vertically or horizontally (mirror).</p>
