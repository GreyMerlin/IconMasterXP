	<h2 id="1">Portable Network Graphics (PNG)</h2>
	<p>
		This is an open-source image format which offers lossless compression and up to
		four colour channels. Its main advantage is its transparency support - fourth or
		so called 'alpha' channel which enables designers to play around with transparency
		masks. Use of Png is not limited to network or web usage, it is now considered a
		technology standard. Windows Vista&reg; icon format is based on Png. This format is
		most commonly used among icon designers and then converted into Ico format through
		software such as IconMasterXP.

	<h2 id="bmp">Windows&reg; Bitmaps (BMP)</h2>
	<p>
		Standard, Windows&reg; image format. Images are generally stored with a color depth
		of 2 (1-bit), 16 (4-bit), 256 (8-bit), 65,536 (16-bit), or 16.7 million (24-bit).
		An alpha channel (for transparency) may be stored in a separate file, where it is
		similar to a grayscale image. 8-bit images can also be grayscale instead of indexed
		color. BMP files are usually not compressed, so they are typically much larger than
		compressed image file formats for the same image. The typical true-color bitmap
		size in bytes can be calculated as: (width in pixels)×(height in pixels)×3+54. So
		an 800×600 image will occupy almost 1.5 megabytes. Nevertheless, the simplicity
		of BMP and its widespread familiarity in Windows&reg; and elsewhere, as well as the
		fact that this format is well documented and free of patents, makes it a very common
		format that image-processing programs from many operating systems can read and write.

	<h2 id="wbmp">Wireless Bitmaps (WBMP)</h2>
	<p>
		Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap Format (shortened to Wireless Bitmap and with
		file extension .wbmp) is a graphic format optimized for mobile computing devices.
		A WBMP file defined is a simple black-and-white image file with one bit per pixel
		and no compression.
		<br /><a href="#top">^ top</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="ico">Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg; Icons (ICO)</h2>
	<p>
		The Ico file format is an image file format used for icons in Windows&reg; systems.
		It contains small images at multiple resolutions and sizes each of which is made
		up of two bitmaps the "and" bitmap and the "xor" bitmap. The "and" bitmap is 1 bit
		and is applied first to decide which areas of the image are affected by the background.
		The "xor" bitmap is then applied using xor operation. This allows for transparent
		areas in the image but also allows for inverting the background and other tricks.
		Originally 32x32 pixels square and using 16 colors, more recent versions of windows
		support icons at multiple sizes and color depths. Current icon files hold images
		of typically 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 and 256x256 pixels at 4, 8, and 32 bit
		(24 bits plus 8 bits alpha channel) color depth.

	<h2 id="tif">Tagged Image Format (TIF; TIFF)</h2>
	<p>
		Tagged Image File Format is a file format for mainly storing raster images, including
		photographs and line art - commonly used for printing operations. Originally created
		by Aldus&reg; Company for use with PostScript&reg; printing, TIFF is a popular format
		for high color depth (32-bit) images, along with JPEG and PNG. TIFF format (also
		known as TIF, for its file extension on Windows&reg; systems), is widely supported
		by image-manipulation applications such as Photoshop&reg; by Adobe&reg; and Paint
		Shop Pro&reg; by Corel&reg;, by desktop publishing and page layout applications,
		such as QuarkXPress&reg; and Adobe&reg; InDesign&reg;, and by scanning, faxing,
		word processing, optical character recognition (OCR), and other applications. Adobe&reg;
		Systems, which acquired the PageMaker&reg; publishing program from Aldus&reg;, now
		controls the TIFF specification.

	<h2 id="tga">Targa Bitmaps (TGA)</h2>
	<p>
		Truevision TGA is a raster graphics file format. It was the native format of Truevision
		Inc.'s TARGA boards, which were some of the first graphic cards for IBM&reg;-compatible
		PCs to support true-color display. TGA files commonly have the extension TGA on
		PC DOS&reg;/Windows&reg; systems, and TPIC on Macintosh&reg; systems. The format
		can store image data with 1–32 bits of precision per pixel. Color data can be color-mapped,
		or in direct-color or true-color format; optionally, a lossless RLE compression
		can be employed.

	</p>

	<h2 id="pcx">ZSoft Paintbrush (PCX)</h2>
	<p>
		PCX is an image file format that uses a simple form of run-length encoding (a type
		of lossless compression algorithm). PCX was developed by the ZSoft Corporation of
		Marietta, Georgia, USA. It was the native file format for their PC Paintbrush&reg;
		graphics program, which was one of the first popular DOS&reg; graphics programs
		for early PCs. Most PCX files use a color palette, but the format has also been
		extended to allow 24-bit images. PCX was quite popular on early DOS&reg; and Windows&reg;
		systems, but is nowadays rare, having been largely replaced by formats which support
		better compression, such as GIF, JPEG and PNG.
		<br /><a href="#top">^ top</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="wmf">Windows&reg; Metafile (WMF/EMF)</h2>
	<p>
		Windows&reg; Metafile is a common graphics file format on Windows&reg; systems. It is a vector
		graphics format, which also allows the inclusion of raster graphics. Essentially,
		a WMF file stores a list of commands that have to be issued to the Windows&reg; graphics
		layer GDI in order to restore the image.<br />
		WMF is a 16-bit format introduced in Windows&reg; 3; a newer 32-bit version with additional
		commands is called Enhanced Metafile (EMF). EMF is also used as a graphics language
		for printer drivers.

	</p>

	<h2 if="jpg">Joint Photographic Experts Group Format (JPG; JPEG)</h2>
	<p>
		JPEG/JFIF is the most common format used for storing and transmitting photographs
		on the World Wide Web. It is not as well suited for line drawings and other textual
		or iconic graphics because its compression method performs badly on these types
		of images. The PNG and GIF formats are in common use for that purpose; GIF, having
		only 8 bits per pixel is not well suited for color photographs, PNG can be used
		to store photographs but the file size makes it largely unsuitable for putting photographs
		on the web.<br />
		JPEG is at its best on photographs and paintings of realistic scenes with smooth
		variations of tone and color. In this case it usually performs much better than
		purely lossless methods while still giving a good looking image (in fact it will
		produce a much higher quality image than other common methods such as GIF which
		are lossless for drawings and iconic graphics but require severe quantization for
		full-color images). If you look at Figure 1 and Figure 2 pictures, you can see the
		great difference in edges and background, the second picture is over 5 times smaller
		in bytes.

	<h2 id="jp2">JPEG 2000 Format (JP2; J2K)</h2>
	<p>
		JPEG 2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard. It was created by the Joint
		Photographic Experts Group committee with the intention of superseding their original
		discrete cosine transform-based JPEG standard. It can operate at higher compression
		ratios without generating the characteristic 'blocky and blurry' artifacts of the
		original DCT-based JPEG standard. It also allows more sophisticated progressive
		downloads. JPEG 2000 is not yet widely supported in web browsers, and hence is not
		generally used on the World Wide Web.
		<br /><a href="#top">^ top</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="pnm">Portable Pixmap Format (PNM)</h2>
	<p>
		The portable pixmap file format (PPM), the portable greymap file format (PGM) and
		the portable bitmap file format (PBM) specify rules for exchanging graphics files.
		They provide very basic functionality and serve as a least-common-denominator for
		converting pixmap, greymap, or bitmap files between different platforms.
		<br /><a href="#top">^ top</a>
	</p>

	<h2 id="psd">Adobe Photoshop Format (PSD)</h2>
	<p>
		Native format of Adobe&reg; Photoshop&reg;. See <a href="System Requirements.htm">system
			requirements</a> for more details on psd2png utility which is used to import
		these files. This format cannot be exported.
