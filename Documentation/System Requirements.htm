	<h1>System Requirements</h1>
	<p>
		Minimum version of Windows&reg; operating system for using IconMasterXP is Windows2000&reg;.
		There are no hardware requirements but it is recommended that you use 32bit color mode in
		your system video settings. 
	</p>
	<h2>Psd2Png External Utility</h2>
	<p>
		An external utility is shipped with IconMasterXP for additional options. This small
		freeware program is used to convert PhotoShop&reg; images (PSD) to Portable Network
		Graphic images (PNG). It supports all kinds of PSD versions and formats, successfully
		converting files exported with Gimp, Photo-Paint&reg; and other programs. Although
		tested by IconMasterXP authors, psd2png may not always give desired results as it
		lacks documentation. To use this program outside of IconMasterXP, you simply have
		to type “psd2png [psd file name]" and resulting PNG will be placed in “PNG” subdirectory
		of the current directory. Condition is however, that if this program is not in your
		Windows directory – you can only convert files that are in same directory as the
		psd2png.exe program. Note that you cannot specify output filenames and that you
		can use wildcard characters. Additionally, program is unable to convert images in
		LAB or CMYK color modes.
